This is a Whale Vocalization Tweaker:

This project is about converting regular text into a language that mimics how whales communicate. Whales communicate using sounds that mainly consist of vowels (like 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and don't use consonants or the letter 'y'.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

You start with any phrase you want to translate. For example, if your phrase is "Hello World".

TRANSLATION RULES:

Only vowels are used: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
The letters 'e' and 'u' are emphasized, so they are doubled in the translated output.
Translation Process:

CONVERT EACH LETTER INTO WHALE LANGUAGE:

If the letter is 'e' or 'u', you write it twice.
Other vowels ('a', 'i', 'o') are written once.
Consonants and 'y' are ignored.
Output: After translating, you get a new version of your phrase that follows these rules. For example, "Hello World!" translates to "EOO" in WHALE talk.

MORE TIPS AND STEPS ON HOW TO FULLY USE THE PROGRAM:

Capitalize all letters of the translated phrase.
Print both the original phrase and the translated whale talk version to see the difference.
